# Fantascraper
General scripts for fantasy EPL

Fantascraper.py is pretty much nonfunctional at the moment.
physioroom.py works from cli for one player at a time (though maybe not anymore).

##TODO

1. Switch to using http://www.rotoworld.com/teams/injuries/bpl/all/
2. Take physioroom from PoC to real, classed code
3. Allow bulk import (ie whole team at a time)
4. Add script to check starting lineups via twitter
5. Pull team lineup
